Q-Pay is an electronic payment platform that aims at increasing finance and accounts management by:
Keeping track of all your transactions, provide periodic reports on your expenditures and enable payments to be done from the system to online systems and local shops.

Users will disburse money into their Q-Pay accounts straight from: MPesa, TigoPesa and other mobile money services or by cash-in straight to Q-Pay Administrator and once money is in their accounts, they can use it in contexts elaborated above.
Upon successful registration, users will be issued with Express Checkout Cards (ECC) that will be used for local payments and will also be given username and password that will be used for online payments. The following are the two scenarios that the system will be used on:

Online:
People will purchase and confirm payments using username and password and money will be deducted from buyers account and transferred to sellers account.

On Local:
People will use their ECCâ€™s to scan and put password to confirm payments. Scanned Card will identify user and will be followed with Password entered so that every user will be uniquely identified. This is for security reasons that cardholder has to put password after card being scanned to avoid hijacking ECCs

PS: The Express Checkout Card system will work together with an android application that we plan to create for demonstration purpose only. For all merchants that would want to use our system, they will need an android app to read the cards and complete transactions.
